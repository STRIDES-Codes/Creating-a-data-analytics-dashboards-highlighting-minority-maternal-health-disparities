# Abstract
Our vision is to jump-start the creation of data analytics dashboards highlighting minority maternal health disparities using publicly-available data.

We hope to utilize modern data cleaning/wrangling techniques to prepare publicly-accessible datasets for analysis, modern tools to build (and potentially host) public-facing data dashboards, and both modern/traditional statistical methods (potentially including machine learning!) in our analyses.

# Keywords
minority health, maternal health, data analysis, dashboard, health disparities, people of color, health inequity, neonate

# Introduction
Despite modern medical advancements and public health initiatives, the United States continues to perform poorly on maternal health related metrics. These poor outcomes are especially severe for minority communities. Research points to differences in hospital quality, limited access to care, and chronic diseases as reasons for these disparities. However, larger systemic inequities including structural racism, educational opportunities, and gender hierarchy likely contribute. 
# Methods
Insert methods here, with the two required subsections as described below:
# Implementation
This tool aggregates data about minority maternal health to demonstrate the complex systemic (national and community based) factors that contribute to maternal and neonatal health disparities. For now, the data is aggregated from 2019 Birth Certificate Data from the CDC accessible via WONDER (https://wonder.cdc.gov). 

This section describes how the tool works and relevant technical details for implementation.
# Operation
This section should include the minimal system requirements needed to run the software and an overview of the workflow
# Results
Include if the paper includes novel data or analyses; should be written as a traditional results section (otherwise, include a Use Cases section).
# Use Cases
If not including a Results section, include this section. Examples of input and output files should be provided with some explanatory context. Any novel or complex variable parameters should be explained in sufficient detail to enable users to understand and use the tool's functionality.
# Conclusion and next steps
This section should include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of any novel datasets. Also include any next steps for future development (whether your group actually plans to do this or these steps are just included a guidance for potential future development).
# Data and software availability
Source code for new software must be made openly, and permanently available in a structured repository such as Zenodo (the F1000Research team can assist with deposition), as well as uploaded to a Version Control System (VCS) such as GitHub, BitBucket or SourceForge. Please provide details in a section entitled “Software availability”, listing the repository and the license under which the software can be used in the article. Source code must be assigned an open license.

#Suggested Reviewers
Please pick ten suggested reviewers with whom you have not published in the last three years and who do not work in the same department.  Papers can not be sent to F1000 research without such a list.  
# Author contributions
F1000R uses the CRediT Taxonomy for author contributions.  For each author, list their contribution(s) from the list below.  Anyone who contributed in another capacity or otherwise does not meet the criteria for authorship (e.g. they did not review the final manuscript) should be included in the acknowledgements.

# Figures and Tables
All figures and tables should be cited and discussed in the article text. Figure legends and tables should be added at the end of the manuscript. Tables should be formatted using the ‘insert table’ function in Word, or provided as an Excel file. Files for figures should be uploaded as separate files through the submission system. Each figure or table should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. A legend for each figure and table should also be provided that briefly describes the key points and explains any symbols and abbreviations used. The legend should be sufficiently detailed so that the figure or table can stand alone from the main text.
